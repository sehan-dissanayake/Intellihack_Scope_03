# LLM Fine-tuning Challenge: Enhancing Qwen 2.5-3B for AI Research QA

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to fine-tuning the Qwen 2.5-3B model for specialized AI research question-answering. The implementation focuses on creating an efficient domain-specific QA system that can accurately answer questions about technical AI infrastructure concepts, particularly those related to distributed file systems and performance optimization.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The project implements a complete pipeline for:

1. Processing technical research documents
2. Generating high-quality synthetic QA pairs
3. Fine-tuning Qwen 2.5-3B using QLoRA
4. Building a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
5. Evaluating model performance using multiple metrics

## ðŸ§© Components
